**Time-Series Databases** (TSDBs) are optimized for storing and querying data that is indexed by time. These databases are designed to handle large volumes of time-stamped data and allow for efficient querying based on time ranges, aggregation, and downsampling. TSDBs are commonly used for applications such as monitoring systems, IoT data, financial data, sensor data, and any other use case where time-based data is generated.
