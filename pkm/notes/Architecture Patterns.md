Software **architecture patterns** are standardized, high-level structures that provide templates for organizing entire software systems. They represent proven solutions to recurring architectural challenges, offering a foundation upon which software architects can build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.

Key software architecture patterns include:
# Monolithic Architecture

- Encapsulates all functionality in a single deployable unit
- Simplifies development and deployment for smaller applications
- Becomes challenging to maintain as complexity grows
- Examples: Traditional enterprise applications
# Layered Architecture

- Organizes components into horizontal layers (presentation, business logic, data access)
- Each layer has a specific responsibility and serves the layer above it
- Promotes separation of concerns and clear dependencies
- Examples: Traditional web applications, enterprise systems
# Client-Server

- Divides functionality between service providers (servers) and service consumers (clients)
- Centralizes data storage and processing on servers
- Enables multiple clients to access shared resources
- Examples: Web applications, database systems, email systems
# Microservices

- Decomposes applications into small, independent services
- Each service has its own database and business logic
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- Enables independent deployment and scaling
- Examples: Netflix, Amazon, Uber
# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- Structures applications as collections of loosely coupled services
- Services represent business functions
- Emphasizes interoperability across platforms
- Often implemented using enterprise service bus (ESB)
- Examples: Enterprise integration systems
# Event-Driven Architecture

- Components communicate through events or messages
- Publishers emit events without knowledge of subscribers
- Promotes loose coupling between components
- Well-suited for reactive and real-time systems
- Examples: Trading platforms, IoT applications
# Serverless Architecture

- Developers focus on individual functions rather than servers
- Cloud provider manages infrastructure scaling and provisioning
- Pay-per-execution pricing model
- Examples: AWS Lambda applications, Azure Functions
# Space-Based Architecture

- Distributes processing and storage across multiple servers
- Data is replicated across nodes
- Eliminates traditional bottlenecks
- Well-suited for high-volume applications
- Examples: High-traffic websites, gaming platforms
# Pipe and Filter

- Processes data through a series of independent processing components (filters)
- Data flows through pipes between filters
- Each filter performs a specific operation
- Examples: ETL systems, compilers
# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Structures system around the business domain
- Uses ubiquitous language shared by developers and domain experts
- Implements bounded contexts to handle complex domains
- Examples: Complex business applications
# Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

- Isolates business logic from external concerns
- Uses ports (interfaces) and adapters to connect to external systems
- Facilitates testing and maintenance
- Examples: Enterprise applications requiring flexibility
