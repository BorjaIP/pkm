NoSQL is an approach to database design that focuses on providing a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.Â Instead of the typical tabular structure of a relational database, NoSQL databases house data within one data structure

- Designed for unstructured and semi-structured data.
- Offers scalability and flexibility.
- Further divided into:
    - **Document Stores**: [[MongoDB]], [[Elasticsearch]], CouchDB (stores JSON-like documents).
    - **Key-Value Stores**: Redis, [[DynamoDB]] (uses key-value pairs).
    - **Column-Family Stores**: Apache Cassandra, HBase (optimized for big data analytics).
    - **Graph Databases**: Neo4j, ArangoDB (ideal for relationships and network analysis).
