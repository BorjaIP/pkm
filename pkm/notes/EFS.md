**Elastic File System** (EFS) provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. Amazon EFS is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Because Amazon EFS has a simple web services interface, you can create and configure file systems quickly and easily. The service manages all the file storage infrastructure for you, meaning that you can avoid the complexity of deploying, patching, and maintaining complex file system configurations.

- Supports Network File System version 4(**NFSv4**) protocol
- **Only pay** for the storage you use
- Can scale up to **petabytes**
- Can support thousands of concurrent **NFS connections**
- Data is stored across **multiples AZs** within a region
- Read-after-write consistency
- **Used for Highly scalable shared storage using NFS.**
