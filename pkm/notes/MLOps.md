MLOps or ML Ops is a paradigm that aims to deploy and maintain [[Machine Learning]] models in production reliably and efficiently. The word is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous development practice of [[DevOps]] in the software field. Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems.
