**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by Anthropic to facilitate seamless interaction between AI models and external tools or data sources. It standardizes the way applications provide context to large language models (LLMs), enabling structured, secure, and efficient communication.

Key features of MCP include:

- **Standardized Interface**: MCP provides a universal protocol for AI models to access external data and tools, reducing the need for custom integrations .
- **Model-Agnostic Design**: It works across various AI models, including those from OpenAI and Anthropic, ensuring broad applicability .
- **Structured Communication**: MCP utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 for structured messaging, allowing for clear and organized interactions between AI models and external systems .
- **Security and Control**: Organizations retain full control over their data, with MCP supporting secure access protocols and authentication mechanisms .
