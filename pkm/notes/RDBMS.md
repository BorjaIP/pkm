RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System used to maintain a relational database. RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems:

- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- [[PostgreSQL]]
- [[AlloyDB]]

# ORM

ORM produces a structured map that reveals the relationships between objects and tables, or data, without getting into the minutiae of the [data structure](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-structures). Objects are essentially converted into digestible parts that a database can store for future retrieval. ORM connects object-oriented programming languages ([[Python]]) or applications with a relational database, communicating any changes made to an object to the database, which then alters the data accordingly.   

Because ORM monitors and handles interface changes, developers don’t need to worry about editing code on a constant basis. This technique also enables teams to understand how a database is structured without needing to review the code, making it easier to glean insights from complex states and codes generated by object-oriented programs.
# OLTP

OLTP (online transaction processing) is a class of software programs capable of supporting **transaction** -oriented applications. In computing, a **transaction is a sequence of discrete information exchanges that are treated as a unit**. Many everyday acts involve OLTP, including online banking, online shopping and even in-store shopping when the point of sale (POS) terminal is tied to inventory management software.

OLTP systems were originally designed to handle only operational data. They process various different kinds of queries and are geared toward surface-level transactions. Today, some **in-memory databases** are able to process memory-optimized tables of transaction data stored in system memory instead of having to pull them from disk storage. This approach is called in-memory OLTP.
## Transaction

In computing, a **transaction is a set of related tasks treated as a single action**. Together the tasks form a logical unit of work in which all of them must succeed or none of them can succeed. If some tasks succeed but at least one fails, then all successful tasks are reversed, returning the system to its original state before the transaction was initiated (roll back).

A common example of a transaction is a customer's purchase through an e-commerce site. After selecting a product and entering the necessary information, the customer confirms the final sale by clicking OK or taking some other step to conclude the process. This causes the application to launch a sales transaction, which includes multiple steps, such as confirming the product's availability, validating the credit card, initiating the shipping process and placing the order with the warehouse.
## ACID

Transactions in a relational database typically adhere to the following four **ACID properties**:

- **Atomicity**. All operations within the transaction are treated as a single unit. **This means that all operations must succeed for any changes to be committed to the database**. If any operation fails, no changes are committed, and the entire transaction is rolled back.
- **Consistency**. The data remains in a consistent state throughout the transaction's execution and is left in a consistent statement at the end of the transaction. The transaction should make no changes that violate any constraints defined on the data.
- **Isolation**. Each transaction is isolated from all other transactions running concurrently against the database. A transaction should not interfere with another transaction or affect it in any way. The degree to which transactions are isolated from each other is determined by the applicable isolation levels.
- **Durability**. Any changes made by a transaction after it has been committed are persisted to the database and cannot be undone by outside circumstances, such as a hardware failure or power outage.
