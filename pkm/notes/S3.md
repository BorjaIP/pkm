**Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
## Storage Classes

Check out the documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/).

- Storage strategy for setup lifecycle rules :
	- Standard - keep for 30 days
	- IA - After 30 days
	- Glacier - After 90 days
## Object Lock

- Use **S3 Object Lock**  to store objects using a write once, read many model.(WORM)
- Use WORM in a **Vault Lock Policy** and lock the policy from future edits.
- Object lock can be on **individual model** or applied **across the bucket** as a whole.
- Object Lock comes in two modes: 
	- **Governance mode**: users cant **overwrite or delete** an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have **special permissions**.
	- **Compliance mode**: a protected object version cant be **overwritten or deleted** by any user, including **root user.**

- **Legal Hold**: prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. They look a little like this: `s3:PutObjectLegalHold`.
- **Glacier Vault Lock**: easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vault with a vault lock policy such as WORM.
## Encryption

- Encryption in Transit with **SSL/TLS** and **HTTPS**.
- Encryption in Rest:
	- Server-side encryption
	- SSE-S3 (AES 256-bit)
	- SSE-KMS
	- SSE-C
- Client-Side encryption, you encrypt the files previously.
- Enforcing encryption with a Bucket Policy
	- Create a policy that **Deny** all **PUT request** that don't include `x-amz-server-side-encryption` in header.

- **Server-side encryption** - Legacy workflow:
	1 - The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter will be included in the request header.
	2 - Two options: `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` or `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms`
	3 - PUT request header is included and tells S3 to encrypt the object at the time of upload.  
## Tips

- Files up to **5TB**.
- Unlimited storage.
- S3 is a **universal namespaces**.
- S3 Objects: 
	- **Key**: object name
	- **Value**: data itself
	- **Version** ID: for store multiple versions of the same object
	- **Metadata**: data about the data storing
- Object ACLs (Access control list): make **individual object** public using ACLs.
- Buckets are **private by default**.
- Buckets policies: can make **entire buckets** public using bucket policies.
- **HTTP status code**: upload S3 object to S3 return **200 HTTP status code**.
- **Static Content**: use S3 to host statis content only (not dynamic)
- **Automatic Scaling**: S3 scales automatically with demand.
- All versions are **stored** in S3 includes **all writes and delete object** events.
- **Version cannot be disabled** only suspended.
- Version support MFA.
- Use **Multipart Upload** and **S3 Byte-Range Fetches (Parallel Downloads)** files for better performance.
- Better performance with **different prefixes** (prefix is like a directory), its important to organize all the data in different prefixes.
- Files **over 5GB** must be use multipart upload.
- If you **encrypt S3** objects with SEE-KMS, KMS limits are affected and will count **KMS quota** for upload/download and cannot increases that.
- You need to create a **Batch Job** for replicate existing objects.
- Delete markers are **not replicated by default**.
