A **vector database**, **vector store** or **vector search engine** is a [[Databases|database]] that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more [Approximate Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximation_methods "Nearest neighbor search") (ANN) algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records.
