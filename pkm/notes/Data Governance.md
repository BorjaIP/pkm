**Data governance** is the formal management of data assets within an organization through the combination of people, processes, and technology. It establishes a framework of policies, procedures, standards, and metrics that ensure data is used effectively, efficiently, securely, and in compliance with relevant regulations.

Key components of data governance include:

- **Data quality management**: Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability
- **Data security and privacy**: Protecting sensitive information and meeting compliance requirements
- **Data ownership**: Defining clear roles and responsibilities for data management
- **Metadata management**: Documenting data sources, definitions, and relationships
- **Data lifecycle management**: Managing data from creation through archival and deletion
- **Data access controls**: Determining who can view, modify, or use specific data

Effective data governance helps organizations reduce risks, improve decision-making, increase operational efficiency, maintain regulatory compliance, and maximize the value of their data assets.

# Metadata

Metadata is "data about data" that provides context, meaning, and characteristics of data assets. In a data governance framework, metadata serves as a critical documentation layer that helps organizations understand, manage, and effectively use their data resources.

Types of metadata include:

- **Technical metadata**: Format, schema, size, location, and technical specifications
- **Business metadata**: Definitions, ownership, purpose, and business context
- **Operational metadata**: Creation/modification dates, usage statistics, access logs
- **Administrative metadata**: Access permissions, retention policies, compliance requirements

# Data Lineage

Data lineage tracks data's complete journey through systems from its origin to its destination, documenting all transformations, movements, and dependencies along the way. It creates a visual map or documentation of how data flows through an organization.

Data lineage captures:

- Data origins (source systems)
- Transformations and calculations applied
- Movement between systems and databases
- Business processes that use or modify the data
- Output locations and downstream dependencies
