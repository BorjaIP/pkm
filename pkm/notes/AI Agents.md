Agentic [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] refers to artificial intelligence capable of making decisions, planning, and adapting to new information in real time. AI agents learn and enhance their performance through feedback, utilizing advanced algorithms and sensory inputs to execute tasks and engage with their environments.

AI agent features three key characteristics:

- **Planning:** an AI agent is capable of creating a step-by-step plan with discrete milestone goals from a prompt while learning from mistakes via a reward system to improve future outputs.
- **Memory:** an AI agent combines the ability to use short-term memory to process chat-based prompts and follow-up prompts with longer-term data retention and recall (often [[RAG]]).
- **Tool use:** an agent can query APIs to request additional information or execute an action based on an end user’s request.
