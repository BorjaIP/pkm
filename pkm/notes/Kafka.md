[[Apache]] Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Originally developed by LinkedIn and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams across distributed systems. It acts as a message broker, facilitating the continuous exchange of data between producers (sources of data) and consumers (applications that process data).

Kafka's key features include its ability to scale horizontally across multiple servers, fault tolerance, and the ability to retain large volumes of data for extended periods. It supports use cases such as real-time analytics, event-driven architectures, log aggregation, and streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. With its publish-subscribe model, Kafka has become a critical component in modern data architectures, enabling organizations to build scalable, high-performance streaming platforms.
