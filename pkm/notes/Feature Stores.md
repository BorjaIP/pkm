A **feature store** is a centralised repository that stores curated features. It is a data management layer that allows data scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers to collaborate, share and discover features. Another way to think about it is that feature stores interface between the raw data and the models. It takes raw data and then transforms it into features subsequently used for model training and inference. This ensures that the features used across both models are consistent.

# Feature

In [[machine learning]], features are used as inputs into a machine learning model. It is arguably the most critical ingredient for successful machine learning. Features are also sometimes referred to as **variables** or **attributes**.For example, the tabular data below is an example dataset used to build a machine learning model predicting future sales of a store. The features are columns in the table used as inputs into a machine learning model.
