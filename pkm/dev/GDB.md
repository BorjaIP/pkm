A **graph database** (**GDB**) is a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) that uses [graph structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure) "Graph (data structure)") for [semantic queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_query "Semantic query") with [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(graph_theory) "Node (graph theory)"), [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory) "Edge (graph theory)"), and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the _[graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)")_ (or _edge_ or _relationship_). The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly and, in many cases, retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships is fast because they are perpetually stored in the database.
