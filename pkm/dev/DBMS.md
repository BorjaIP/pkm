A database is an organized collection of information that is stored electronically so information can be maintained, accessed, and analyzed efficiently.

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software program that is used to manage the database. Additionally, other applications and end-users interact with the database through the DBMS.

The DBMS and the data it manages together make up what's called a **database system**, often shortened to just “database”.
