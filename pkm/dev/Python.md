Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its clean, easy-to-understand syntax, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its functionality.
