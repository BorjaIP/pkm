**X as a service** (rendered as **aaS** in acronyms) is a phrasal template for any business model in which a product use is offered as a subscription-based service rather than as an artifact owned and maintained by the customer. Originating from the software as a service concept that appeared in the 2010s with the advent of cloud computing the template has expanded to numerous offerings in the field of information technology and beyond it.
