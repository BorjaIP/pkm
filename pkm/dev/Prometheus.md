**Prometheus** is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting. It records metrics in a time series database built using an HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.

[[Kubernetes]], [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt) are a trio of technologies that have transformed cloud native development. However, despite how powerful these three technologies are, developers still face gaps in the process of implementing a mature Kubernetes environment.
