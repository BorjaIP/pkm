An **operating system** (OS) manages all other applications and programs in a computer, and it is loaded into the computer by a boot program. It enables applications to interact with a computer’s hardware. Through a designated application program interface, the application programs request services from the operating system ([[API]]). The kernel is the software that contains the operating system’s core components. To run other programs, every computer has to have at least one operating system installed.

The kernel is the core component of an operating system for a computer (OS). All other components of the OS rely on the core to supply them with essential services. It serves as the primary interface between the OS and the hardware and aids in the control of devices, networking, file systems, and process and memory management.
