[Istio](https://istio.io/)Â makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, then configure and manage Istio using its control plane functionality. Was developed on top of [[Kubernetes]].
