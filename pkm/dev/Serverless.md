**Serverless** computing is a [[cloud]] computing model where cloud providers dynamically manage server infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server maintenance. Key characteristics include:

- Automatic scaling based on application demand
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Reduced operational overhead
- Quick deployment and updates
- Support for event-driven architectures

Developers write function-specific code (called "functions") that run in **stateless compute containers managed entirely by the cloud provider**. Popular serverless platforms include [[AWS]] Lambda, [[Azure]] Functions, and Google Cloud Functions ([[GCP]]).

Use cases include web backends, data processing, IoT applications, and microservices architectures. Benefits include cost efficiency, improved developer productivity, and built-in scalability.
