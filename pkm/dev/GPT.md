**GPT** is a family of AI models built by OpenAI. It stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which is basically a description of what the AI models do and how they work (I'll dig into that more in a minute).

The GPT models are designed to generate human-like text in response to a [prompt](https://zapier.com/blog/gpt-prompt/). Initially, these prompts had to be text-based, but the latest versions of GPT can also work with images.
