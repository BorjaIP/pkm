**Data Extraction** retrieves structured or unstructured data from various sources, such as websites, databases, documents, or APIs. This information can be in text, images, files, or any other digital format. The extracted data is then typically transformed and stored for analysis or further use.

The primary purpose of data extraction is **to make raw data accessible and usable for analytics, business intelligence, and AI/ML applications**. Organizations extract data to consolidate information from disparate sources, clean and standardize it, and prepare it for deeper analysis.
