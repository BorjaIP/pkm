RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System used to maintain a relational database. RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and [[PostgreSQL]].
## ORM

ORM produces a structured map that reveals the relationships between objects and tables, or data, without getting into the minutiae of the [data structure](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-structures). Objects are essentially converted into digestible parts that a database can store for future retrieval. ORM connects object-oriented [programming languages](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/new-programming-languages) ([[Python]]) or applications with a relational database, communicating any changes made to an object to the database, which then alters the data accordingly.   

Because ORM monitors and handles interface changes, developers don’t need to worry about editing code on a constant basis. This technique also enables teams to understand how a database is structured without needing to review the code, making it easier to glean insights from complex states and codes generated by object-oriented programs.
