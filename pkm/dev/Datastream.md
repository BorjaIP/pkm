**Datastream** is a serverless and easy-to-use change data capture (**CDC**) and replication service that lets you synchronize data reliably, and with minimal latency.

Datastream provides seamless replication of data from operational databases into [[BigQuery]]. In addition, Datastream supports writing the change event stream into Cloud Storage, and offers streamlined integration with Dataflow templates to build custom workflows for loading data into a wide range of destinations, such as Cloud SQL and Spanner.
