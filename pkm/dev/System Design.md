**System design** is the process of defining the [[architecture]], components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves:

Key Considerations:

- Scalability: Ability to handle growing amounts of work
- Performance: System efficiency and response times
- Reliability: System's consistency and fault tolerance
- Security: Protection against potential threats
- Cost-effectiveness: Balancing system capabilities with resource constraints
