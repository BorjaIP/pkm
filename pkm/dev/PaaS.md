Cloud platform services, also known as **platform as a service** (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework that developers can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

Using PaaS offers numerous advantages, including:

- Simple, cost-effective development and deployment of applications
- Scalability
- Highly available
- Application customization without software maintenance
- Significant reduction in the amount of coding needed
- Automation of business policy
- Easy migration to theÂ hybrid model
