**Trading** is the process of buying and selling assets - like stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, forex (foreign exchange), or other financial instruments - with the goal of making a profit from price movements. Traders can profit in two main ways:

1. Going "long" - buying an asset hoping its price will rise
2. Going "short" - betting against an asset hoping its price will fall

Traders typically use various strategies and analysis methods:

- Technical analysis: Studying price charts and patterns
- Fundamental analysis: Evaluating the underlying value/health of assets
- Sentiment analysis: Gauging market mood and psychology
- Risk management: Using stop losses and position sizing to protect capital
