Flask is a lightweight [[Python]] framework for web applications that provides the basics for URL routing and page rendering.

Flask is called a "micro" framework because it doesn't directly provide features like form validation, database abstraction, authentication, and so on. Such features are instead provided by special Python packages called Flask extensions. The extensions integrate seamlessly with Flask so that they appear as if they were part of Flask itself. For example, Flask doesn't provide a page template engine, but installing Flask includes the Jinja templating engine by default. For convenience, we typically speak of these defaults as part of Flask.
