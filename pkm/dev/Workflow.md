Workflow orchestration means governing your **dataflow** in a way that respects the **orchestration rules** and your **business logic**. A workflow orchestration tool allows you to **schedule**, **run**, and **observe** your workflows.

A **workflow management system** (**WfMS** or **WFMS**) provides an infrastructure for the set-up, performance, and monitoring of a defined sequence of tasks arranged as a [workflow application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_application "Workflow application").
