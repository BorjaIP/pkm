**Cert-manager** adds certificates and certificates issuer as resource types in Kubernetes clusters and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing, and using those certificates. It is running by jet stack under an open-source project.

# Installation

Letâ€™s use [[Helm]] to install cert-manager. Start by adding the appropriate repo:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io  
helm repo update
```

```bash
helm install \  
    cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \  
    --namespace test \  
    --create-namespace \  
    --version v1.11.0 \  
    --set installCRDs=true
```
# Issuer

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
  namespace: test
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

- Self-signed certificate

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1  
kind: Certificate  
metadata:  
  name: test-ca  
  namespace: test  
spec:  
  isCA: true  
  commonName: test-ca  
  subject:  
    organizations:  
      - ACME Inc.  
    organizationalUnits:  
      - Widgets  
  secretName: test-ca-secret  
  privateKey:  
    algorithm: ECDSA  
    size: 256  
  issuerRef:  
    name: selfsigned-issuer  
    kind: Issuer  
    group: cert-manager.io
```

# Cluster Issuer

- Self-signed certificate

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-cluster-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

- Let's encrypt

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    email: app.subdomain@example.com
    server: https://<server>.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: traefik-cert-manager
```

Important to note here is that we will be using an `Issuer` and not a `ClusterIssuer`. The main difference between the two is that an `Issuer` can only issue certificates within the same namespace! If you want your CA to issue certificates in other namespaces as well, you will have to use the `ClusterIssuer`.
