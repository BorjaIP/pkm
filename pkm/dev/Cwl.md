Common Workflow Language ([CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)) is an open standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows.

Tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across a variety of platforms that support the CWL standards. Using CWL, it is easy to scale complex data analysis and machine learning workflows from a single developer's laptop up to massively parallel cluster, cloud and high performance computing environments.
