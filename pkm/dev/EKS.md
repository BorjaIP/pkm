Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ([AmazonÂ EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own [[Kubernetes]] control plane or nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
