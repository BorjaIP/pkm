SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating **relational databases**. First developed in the 1970s by IBM, SQL has become the most widely used language for querying and managing structured data. It allows users to interact with databases by performing tasks such as retrieving data (through SELECT queries), updating records, inserting new data, and deleting unwanted information.

SQL is fundamental to relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, [[PostgreSQL]], Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database. Its core strength lies in its ability to handle large datasets with complex relationships while maintaining data integrity. SQL also supports various powerful features like joins, indexing, and transactions, which enable efficient querying, reporting, and data analysis. Whether in enterprise systems, web applications, or data analytics, SQL remains an essential tool for database management and information retrieval.
