A **large language model** is a type of [[Artificial Intelligence]] algorithm that applies neural network techniques with lots of parameters to process and understand human languages or text using self-supervised learning techniques. Tasks like text generation, machine translation, summary writing, image generation from texts, machine coding, chat-bots, or Conversational AI are applications of the Large Language Model. Examples of such LLM models are Chat GPT by open AI, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) by Google, etc.
