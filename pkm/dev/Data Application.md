A **data application** (or data app) processes and analyzes [[big data]] to rapidly deliver insights or take autonomous action. Data apps place the power of data science, [[machine learning]], artificial intelligence, automation, and other advanced data techniques in the hands of leaders, business users, and more. They are used to empower informed decision-making, boost operational efficiency, drive revenue, and differentiate from competitors.

On the surface level, data apps and [[Bussiness Inteligence |BI]] dashboards may seem to have a lot of similarities. After all, BI dashboards also draw from diverse datasets and serve analytical purposes. However, data apps can provide greater functionality and power to an organization.
